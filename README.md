# Quiz Application

A simple and interactive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to take a quiz, select answers, track their score, and view their final result.

## Features

- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Users are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions.
- **Interactive Answering**: After selecting an answer, the correct answer is displayed.
- **Score Tracking**: Users' scores are updated as they answer questions correctly.
- **Progress Tracking**: Displays which question the user is on (e.g., "Question 1 of 10").
- **Restart Option**: The ability to restart the quiz and reset the score.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the quiz.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a clean, responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling quiz logic such as question navigation, checking answers, and score management.
